Student Management System built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, and CSS.
The project implements role-based authentication with Teacher and Student accounts. 
Teachers can add, view, and delete students, while students have read-only access. 
Secure login, registration, encrypted passwords, protected routes, and clean UI pages were implemented. 
The system demonstrates proper MVC architecture, backend security, and frontend integration with a minimal, user-friendly design.
